Pipeline is seperated into two modules: the Assets module and the Scenes module.

__Assets:__

Charachters, Models, Rigs, Props, Stages or any other components of a production that will be used in animation is created here and published from here.

__Scenes:__


Animatic, Layouts, Animations etc. are composed using published components created in the asset module

_The idea is very simple, however in most productions you wish to keep your project structure as simple as possible, so you can find you way when things get complicated._

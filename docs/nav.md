###The navigation panel

The navigation panel is where we can view and edit our project structure.


#####Branch switcher

Lists all the projects branches.
Setting a branch will display it's content in the folder viewer and the components library.

!!! note
    * Adding and removing branches is done from the project edit window.
    * Users without administration privileges can not edit projects.

#####Search in branch

Enter your search string to filter components in the current branch

!!! bug
    May be slow or hang Maya on branches with many components    

Folder view - works like windows explorer / osx finder to navigate the branch directories and components.

Actions menu - invoke by clicking the folder title or by right clicking.

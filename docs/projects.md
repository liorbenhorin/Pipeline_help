###The projects manager

This is where we manage our projects.
From here we can create projects, load and unload existing projects for quick opening.
Create - opens up the create project dialogue:
Project name - the projects folder name, must be leagal charchters, no spaces.
In some cases where maya is only part of studios pipeline, this will be MAYA.
Nice name - a friendly display name for the project.
Path - where to save the project.

Branches - represent production sections, eg. Assets, animation, render, or any other high level phase of your project.
You can add / remove them later as well.

Users - Assign users to a project when you want to let team members collaborate - but with limited functionality, eg. Simple users can not delete files, and can not save master versions.
Users also help you track who is saving versions.

!!! note
    Projects with users require logging in with password when setting project.

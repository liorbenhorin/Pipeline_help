##Projects

1. Create new projects
2. Load existing projects		
   _A project that was created with Pipeline will have a **project.pipe** file in the root folder,	 
   use this file to load the project_
3. Unload a project from Pipeline	
4. Offline	
   _When a project is not found, Pipeline marks it as Offline,	
   relink it by locating the **project.pipe** file_ 
5. Edit projects parameters, such as defult fps, users, etc.
6. Set project to start working on it	
   _The project marked in green is the active project_   

##Collaboration

Multiple users can work on the same project,	
__even when they are not on a local network, or not sharing the same OS__	

When placing a Pipelin project on a shared folder, ( Dropbox for exemple ),
Each user can load it on his local system, and updates will get synced via the sharing platform.	

_I Recommend using [Sync](https://www.getsync.com/) for collaborations_

2. use the looking glass to locate a root folder to place your project
3. Hit 'Create'

##Create your first asset

1. Catagories - Charchetrs and props
2. Assets - Individual charchters
3. Components - The parts that an asset is made of

_This is just an exemple, you can use this sturcture however you like_ 

##Publishing your first component

When you have a component ready to be used in animation, you need to 'publish' it.  
Once an component is published, it is visible in the 'Reference asset' tab on Scenes mode

1. Save master
